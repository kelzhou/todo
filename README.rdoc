Rails Application for CIS 196

http://salty-shore-1261.herokuapp.com/

I created three models and controllers, Users, Assignments and Events. You can create/edit/destroy to the database for all tables. 
I added validations to the user model and added styling (navbar, tables, forms).

Gems added: formtastic and formtastic-bootstrap
